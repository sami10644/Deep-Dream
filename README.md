## Deep Dream :
DeepDream is an experiment that visualizes the patterns learned by a neural network.
Fellows ,  do install the dependencies and create a virtualenv to run the code .
To play the video install ffmpeg and I also recommend you to use cuda otherwise it will run very slow . Regarding further query you can message me on linkedin (Abdullah As Sami ) or google it ðŸ¥‡
